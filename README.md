# Data Science and Machine Learning Repository 

This repository contains a series of practical implementations and algorithms used in Data Science and Machine Learning, specifically focusing on K-Mean Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Data Analysis using Numpy and Pandas, and a Recommendation System.

The primary sections covered in this repository are:

* **K-Mean Clustering:** An unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into distinct clusters.
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A technique used for dimensionality reduction in machine learning.
* **Data Analysis using Numpy and Pandas:** Provides examples of how to use these libraries for analyzing datasets efficiently.
* **Recommendation System:** An implementation of a recommendation system using a collaborative filtering approach.

## Installation

The following dependencies are necessary to run the codes in this repository:

* Python 3.7 or later
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
